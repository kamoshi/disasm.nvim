INTRODUCTION                                    *disassemble* *dissassmble.nvim*

Whenever you edit a C/C++ file, a set of commands is defined to show in a
popup or in a new buffer the disassembled assembler code of the compiled file.
You can obviously configure the compilation process and the dump of the
assembler code as you whish.

This plugin requires the presence of the *objdump* and binary in the PATH.

The configuration of the plugin is done per buffer (you can have a different
configuration for each file open). The compilation and objdump options are
asked when using for the first time the plugin functions.

COMMANDS                                        *disassemble-commands*

There commands are local to the buffer in which they work.

                                                *:Disassemble*
:Disassemble            Disassemble the current line, and show the result in a
                        popup window. Once the popup opened, it will
                        automatically close on *CursorMoved* or *BufLeave*
                        events.

                                                *:DisassembleFull*
:DisassembleFull        Disassemble the current line, and show the result in a
                        a new buffer. This new buffer is set to 'readonly'
                        with 'filetype' set to 'asm' by default.

:DisassembleConfig      Configure the compilation and objdump export for the
                        current buffer. This configuration is stored in a *b:*
                        variable, hence is done per buffer.
                        
:DisassembleFocus       Focus and move the cursor to the popup window.
